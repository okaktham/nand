# Implementaiton of basic boolean gates
each file contains the Implementaiton of each chip using the toy HDL language provided by Nand2Tetris <br>
each `.hdl` file contains the implementaion of a sepcific chip or "Gate".<br>

Starting with a premitive Nand gate we build each Gate and then use the new gate to build more complex Gates <br>

### Ex: Nand -> (Not, And) -> Or -> Xor and so on
